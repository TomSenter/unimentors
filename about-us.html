                <h2>Our mission</h2>
                <p>Both me and Alex founders of Unimentors, were university students, and found problems we thought we could solve, that's what Unimentors is for. Our mission is two fold, to help university students earn more money to ease their financial situation, and to help students get the help they need to excel in their degree. Studying a degree for 3 years is challenging. We believe in hiring the best tutors, so students can get the best out of their degree and time at university. Financially university can be difficult, which is why all our tutors earn £12-15 an hour, increasing as your reviews do, higher than any other student job.</p>

                <h2>Who we are?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="who-we-are-info-1">
                <p>We are currently a small startup based near London, with big ambitions, we wish to change university education for the better. We both started out at university, and found it hard to keep up with the course content especially with lack of contact hours on our courses, only wishing we had a tutor that was easy to access. We decided to start unimentors summer 2020, as we believe education goes a long way, and finding a good, affordable, knowledgeable tutor, is the difference between a 2:2 and 2:1 or first.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="who-we-are-info-2">
                <p>We both had money issues at university. Rent can be hard to pay, when you add food, clubs/societies you are in, reading materials, and of course going out, you really start to struggle with the loan you were given. Unimentors aims to change this issue too. Most part time jobs for students will be £8-10 an hour, where as our lessons start at £15 an hour. You can do all of this from your uni accomodation, with knowledge you already have, previous years. </p>

            <div class="no-money">
                <h2>No money at university</h2>
                <p>Another common problem we found at university was having no money, and feeling skint all the time. Becoming one of our tutors, means earning an easy income, from your laptop or local library. A lot of student jobs are impossible to schedule around your course. We both worked weekends, and found it hard to juggle that with work in the week. As a unimentors tutor you can schedule your own hours and how much you charge.</p>

                <h2>Getting a job after uni</h2>
                <p>The job market is competitive, I think most people know that nowadays. Having the best degree you can will help you stand out in the crowd. We want to help our students get the degree they want so they can have the career they want. Having a tutor increases the likelihood of getting the best degree you can, as they've been there and done it!</p>
